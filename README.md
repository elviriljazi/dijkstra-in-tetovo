# Optimal Order Distribution using Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Overview
This research project focuses on optimizing order distribution within the city of Tetovo, North Macedonia, leveraging the power of graph theory and Dijkstra's Algorithm. With the rapid growth of e-commerce and delivery services, efficient order distribution is crucial for minimizing delivery times, reducing costs, and enhancing customer satisfaction. By applying graph-based optimization techniques, this project aims to streamline the process of assigning delivery routes to drivers, thereby improving overall logistics efficiency.

## Key Features
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation**: Utilizes Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest paths between delivery points, considering factors such as distance, traffic conditions, and delivery priorities.
- **Geospatial Data Integration**: Integrates geospatial data of Tetovo to construct a graph representation of the city's road network, enabling accurate route calculations.
- ~**Order Prioritization**: Implements algorithms for dynamically prioritizing orders based on factors such as delivery deadlines, customer preferences, and delivery vehicle capacities.
- **Visualization Tools**: Provides visualization tools to display optimized delivery routes, allowing stakeholders to visualize and analyze the distribution plan effectively.~

## Objectives
- Develop a robust software solution for optimizing order distribution in Tetovo, with scalability for potential application in other urban environments.
- Reduce delivery times and operational costs for logistics companies operating within Tetovo.
- Enhance the overall efficiency of order delivery services, leading to improved customer satisfaction and retention.

## Usage
- Researchers and developers interested in logistics optimization algorithms and graph-based route planning techniques.
- Logistics companies seeking to enhance the efficiency of their delivery operations in urban areas.
- Urban planners and policymakers interested in improving traffic flow and reducing congestion through optimized route planning.

## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome! Whether you're interested in adding new features, optimizing algorithms, or improving documentation, your contributions can help make order distribution in Tetovo more efficient and effective.
